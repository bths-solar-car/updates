> Week of: 12/07 to 12/11


## General

* CTC December meeting
* Interested & contacted Makerspace Club and Aerospace club
    * Makerspace can collab on projects, Aerospace might be able to help with shell design
* Required weekly meetings, and advisor now needs to be cc’ed on all emails
    * Will be working on integrating weekend meetings to the weekly ctc mandated meeting
    * But for now the weekly mandated meetings would be just briefs and discussions as well as guest speaking and brainstorming
* Delayed Electrical meeting for a week
* Met with Mr.Adams on Thursday 


## Electrical

* Even without a meeting, Nafi advised us to start by sourcing 96v motors to determine battery voltage, since we know max battery capacity, we can then decide on array specs
    1. In advanced division, the battery has a maximum capacity of 5 kWh. (I see no reason not to max out your battery capacity at the high school level)
        * (Voltage times Amp Hours = kWh)
    2. In case of a DC motor, voltage voltage is essentially proportional to speed. 
    3. The array has no limit on wattage, however there is a price limit of no more than $10/watt. Also, the cells need to be at least 19% efficient to be advanced. There is no limit to sq m. You can put as many sq m of cells on your car as you can fit.
    5. Motor voltage will have to match battery pack voltage. If you have a 96V motor, and run it at 48V battery, you will only get about half the nominal speed.
* Start finding a list of 96V motors


## Mechanical

* Decided on an aluminum chassis with Mr.Adams since he is willing to teach team how to weld
* Learned about differing examples of roll cages/roll bars
* Learned about differing car body design and it’s pros & cons that is relevant to us
* Next week would be sketching of driver’s compartment
* Execs should start work on a Gantt chart of everything
    * Ideally we all work on it with a complete team of division leads


## Programming

* Possible leads: Shaedil, Jason, Rebecca
* Didn’t have a meeting this week
    * Sent out a form to see who is interested in telemetry (6 responses so far)
        * 4 is interested in data management
        * 1 is interested in Scribby (data processing and acquisition program)
    * Possible layout having a lead per project more or less since the area varies so much
* Date for MIT telemetry meet email is coming up; the email is ready to be sent


## Operations

* [Website](https://bths-solar-car.github.io/)
* Fill with edited info (from team slides, ask before disclosing info)
    * Blog seems kinda separate/ unintegrated from the main webpage
* Team updates can be posted here
