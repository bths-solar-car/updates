> Week of: 12/14 to 12/18


## General

* First weekly discussion/meeting
    * Talked about car designs, updates and future plans
* CTC sent out a form for corrections regarding clubs so hopefully our name gets fixed
* Programming and operations had no meeting
* Technical divisions came up with some potential sponsorships for operations to look at
* Jason and Rebecca are respective team leads of programming with Shaedil up for consideration if we need more people
* Break for winter recess
    * This would be our last solar car meeting (except for division leads; mech’s to be announced before break)
    * Division leads meeting would be Friday, 4pm (time adjustable)
        * Discuss and start work on a Gantt chart
    * Team wide meet the Tuesday after break to refresh and discuss future plans for the new year
    * Execs would discuss over break as needed
        * If needed, we will pull in differing division leads but with advanced notices so just let me know in advance if you have anything coming up for the holidays so we can plan accordingly
* Team feedback survey
    * Get feedback from the team on the execs and progress so far


## Electrical

* Looked at hub motors for a 3 wheeled configuration (one powered rear wheel)
    * ISSUE: We looked at bike hub motors and not motorcycle hub motors and the performance difference is immense so we’d have to do some more additional research next meeting
* Settled on brushless dc motors
    * It’s efficient
    * Long lasting
    * Reliable
* Next step is to look or programmable kelly motor controllers


## Mechanical

* Made HUGE developments in our recent meeting (longest meeting in BSCT history...4 hours)
* Decided on
    * 3 wheels
        * Rear wheel would be motorcycle wheel for stability
        * Mounted on swing arms
        * Front suspension would be double wishbone suspension
        * Changed material to Chromoly for chassis and frame
            * Kamil knows how to weld and potentially Mr.Adams
* Debated between the Kogakuin 2017 car design and the Michigan bullet design
    * Decided to design everything in reference to the Kogakuin design since it’ll be very simple to incorporate the designs into the less constraining bullet design (with Nafi)
    * Contacted both Michigan and Kogakuin on the designs to see what their input on our situation was
        * BULLET:
            * Less array dimensions
            * If we expand the dimensions then we would potentially nullify aero aspects to the design
        * KOGAKUIN:
            * We can max out our array
            * More complexity
            * Driver egress a bit difficult but we figured something out
* We’ll work on the roll cage/driver’s compartment next
    * Stanley can teach people inventor as needed
