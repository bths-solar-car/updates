> Week of: 11/30 to 12/04


## General

* *Still* "Solar Cart"
* 12/5 webinar on oral presentations and scrutineering was very helpful
* 11/30 was the team icebreaker, only 2 people were not in attendance
    * Also when we decided upon using the design process learned in DDP to design the differing systems 
* Looking forward to a meeting with Mr.Dazzo and Mr.Adams on 12/7 (Monday)
    * Tell Mr.Adams that we’re heavily considering going advanced
        * Maybe reach out to the NJ team to see how and why they are going advanced
* We have 2 new members. 
    * One is interested in mech and the other is interested in electrical
* Email MIT 12/14 on the telemetry system 
* Still no reply from Toronto
* Started work on a guide/introduction to solar car
* [Design Matrixes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qC7gMv7oVcUNjObTDoOa0sVOXh7vUEbj?usp=sharing)


## Electrical

* Started the design process with constraints and miscellaneous notes on the solar array
* Decided to go with KiCad as our uniform CAD software
* Decided on a custom array (SBM solar)
* Realized that electrical is lacking some people (3 out of 5 people are seniors)


## Mechanical

* Started the design process with constraints and miscellaneous notes on the chassis, roll bar and roll cage. 
* We contacted a manufacturer in Maine about the costs of a fiberglass shell.
    * They specialize in making boats hulls so the curvatures of a solar car should be no problem
    * COVID reduced business so they’ve got a lot of free time to work on the car shell
    * Maine prices are very low compared to NYC prices
* Decided to go with Autodesk Inventor as our uniform CAD software
* Heavily considering using aluminum for the chassis
    * Ask Mr.Adams if he would be willing to teach the team how to weld aluminum
