> Week of: 12/28 to 01/01


## General

* Unified design philosophy (since we’re going to work on the designs for the upcoming months)
  * Attempt ideas but evaluate these design ideas based off of the potential race time gains vs cost.
  * Do not be afraid of testing out ideas, we have the luxury of time for designing out our systems bc of the pandemic (no rush to construction at this point in time)
  * Attempting the route where we’d have the most flexibility in our designs, at the cost of time & labor as well as potentially cost in the form of human error
    * We have the time and resources to work all these issues out beforehand and it shouldn’t be too much of an issue
* [Gantt Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u29asQHFypYQA11AAdYiJFEyTtv6WBiLBMGZBFgmV4s/edit?usp=sharing) completed
* Meeting with Mr. Adams (talked about updates)
* COVID restrictions on design
  * Limited access to hardware
    * No design work possible with microcontrollers and calibrating/fine turning the other systems
    * Only general layouts possible in those scenarios
  * Computing power available
    * Can they run the software & is it laggy at all?
* Monthly planning meeting between division leads and execs bc we’re going to be progressing in design at a faster pace now


## Electrical

* Design decisions
  * Motors
    * Only using 1 motor (1 powered wheel in a 3 wheel configuration)
    * Using a Brushless DC hub Motor (out runner motor)
    * Mostly came down to cost/budget issues
    * Mitsuba motors are the best and most reliable but are very expensive (~$16k)
      * Investment over time
      * QS motors is cheaper but still very high quality (~$3-5k)
        * Lesser power and efficiency (compared to Mitsuba)
    * Since we’re just starting out, we’re going to go with the most feasible option, being the QS motors option
    * Our current plan of action is to contact the company for a quote on a custom 96v motor catered for solar racing
  * Array
    * Flexible and soldered connections between arrays (no MC4 Connectors)
    * MC4 connectors are more suited for beginners and with proper soldering practice, we can have a solid connection without any MC4 connectors
      * To be purchased from SBM Solar
    * Nafi has contacts with Dr. Osbert Cheung, who owns SBM Solar
      * Once decided on car dimensions we can reach out for help on the optimal config. Of our array
  * Battery Pack
    * Premade vs DIY
      * Premade packs are more expensive, heavier, and less configurable to car dimensions & requirements
      * DIY packs are cheaper, lighter, more customizable to specifications
      * Requires battery spot welder though (to be talked about in components section of electrical division slides)
    * Decided on DIY packs
      * RAHS, NJ and Nafi (Uni of Illinois) can help (they’re all working on a DIY battery pack)
  * Going to work on the battery pack project
    * Bring virtual confines the division to specific projects that doesn’t require access to hardware


## Mechanical

* Design Decisions
  * Chromoly tubing
  * Fiberglass shell
    * Anti intrusion panels possibly for added safety
    * Possibly make array backbone out of carbon fiber
  * Track width: 70 cm
  * Wheel base: as long as possible for stability. Means that we lose on maneuverability but our narrow profile makes up for this lack and so we will be fine
    * Overall width: 1m
    * Overall length: 3.57m
      * Kogakuin dimensions
  * Collab with Makerspace
    * On the shell
      * They are very skilled in CAD and we’ll be working along with mech division people to design the shell based off of the tube frame
  * U Michigan Meeting
    * Kamil was very late and Irhaas completely missed it
    * They stressed using Siemens NX software for testing all designs
      * Static Stability Factor & Center of Mass
        * To make sure car does not roll  during a race
    * Offered to check our mechanical designs once complete
    * Mentioned the importance of maximizing stability
    * __Decided on the Kogakuin design__

## Programming

* Shaedil was added as a Telemetry lead
* Decided on getting material ready for our first 2021 meeting, mainly getting people comfortable with Git and Markdown
* We’ve decided that we must learn how to use SQL to efficiently store data
* We’ve decided that we are going ahead with using C for our backend, and Python for data processing rapid development
* Completed the first version of our timeline


## Operations

* Planning:
  * Meet after updates meeting & split into 2 teams:
    * Sponsor materials draft
    * Web dev (making materials to go on website)
  * Meeting on “brand” guidelines, TBD at post-updates meeting
* Actually reaching to to sponsors is contingent on the following:
  * Draft of the shell that will be visually recognizable as our car
* First meeting time would be Tuesday 1/5/21 at 5pm after the updates meeting to split the team up
